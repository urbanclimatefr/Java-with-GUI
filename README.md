# Java-with-GUI
A Java program is developed with a graphical user interface (GUI) to render 2D objects based on user input, visualise some transitions between states and demonstrate how youâ€™ve preserved states between transitions. You must use the same development environment as the one used in this module (Java 11 and JavaFX) to implement the logic and GUI components.
